## Differences from mobile versions (similar in content to wXL23 but native desktop with keyboard shortcuts, etc):
- Nexrad Level 2 is not supported. See the wXL23 [FAQ](https://gitlab.com/joshua.tee/wxl23/-/blob/master/doc/FAQ.md#why-is-level-2-radar-not-the-default) for why I can't provide a good experience with this.
- No notifications or widgets
- No Radar color palette editor
- You must compile it yourself
- Best effort support from me (ie Mobile support takes priority)

## How to add your location
- From the main screen, tap the gear icon in the upper left.
- From the Settings window, tap the "Add Location" tab.
- Enter the name of your city in the text box, as type you will start getting matches. The best match will auto populate the name/lat/lon fields.
- If you want a differen result, tap button that most closely matches your location.
- Tap the save button, when all fields clear the new location has been saved.
- Close settings window
- From the main screen use the drop down to choose your new location

### Performance:
- Using Wayland on a Linux based desktop is optimal

### Output to local filesystem (file should NOT exist before running program for first time):
- `$HOME/.config/joshuatee.wx@gmail.com/wxgtk.conf`

## Compile and run
1. Perform the [steps](https://gitlab.com/joshua.tee/wxgtk/-/blob/main/README_OS.md) for your operating system, you will probably need 8GB of memory for compilation. I have used a 4GB Raspberry PI 400 (keyboard model) to compile.
2. Download the code and and compile/run
```bash
git clone https://gitlab.com/joshua.tee/wxgtk.git
cd wxgtk
./makeAll.bash
```
3. After compilation you can simply launch with script
```bash
./run.bash
```
